                                An understated style. Defined by an unconventional sense of sophistication. With taste
                                that is rarified, yet a touch audacious. Timeless and elegant…but always infused with a
                                charming dash of wit and whimsy.

                                                facilities that celebrate the use of renewable energy and seek to reduce

                                                to better transparency around our responsibly sourced ingredients and

                                            <p>‘Up the garden path’ a collection of candle accessories by set designer
                                                Shona Heath celebrates the heady magic of an English country garden.</p>
                                            <p>In this surreal wonderland of flora and fauna, flowers have cross pollinated
                                                with humans and animals, and then proceed to have a jolly old time frolicking
                                                in nature.</p>
                                            <p>Based on a short story written by Heath, the unusual ceramic items
                                                from the collection include the paint splattered ‘Lesser Spotted Zebra
                                                Diffuser Cover’ with a striped punk inspired hairstyle, and the ‘Blue
                                                Sandwich Duo Tray’ filled with rose and bluebell flowers.</p>
                                            <p> “The name is a metaphor for being led astray,” says Heath on the story
                                                and concept behind the collection. “It’s based on these two characters, Mr
                                                De vingles and Lily. He’s rather stuffy and she’s this polite prim girl.
                                                They walk down the garden path together, and he falls in the roses, something
                                                overcomes him, and he changes into a much nicer person.” Of course, the
                                                pair end up not only as great friends but also transform into flower people,
                                                with petals for hair and stems for arms and legs. “It's a tiny bit
                                                psychedelic and not meant to be taken seriously,” says Heath who was inspired by the
                                                illustrations of Francois Pinet and the peculiar flower people which
                                                inhabit his work. </p>

                                            <p>When the time came to create a new collection of candles specially for
                                                the home,</p> 
                                                <p>we didn’t have to look much further than our headquarters, a
                                                Georgian townhouse in the heart of Marylebone.</p>
                                            <p>With its formal entrance, sweeping
                                                staircase, and well-proportioned rooms which are simultaneously cosy and
                                                intimate, yet also, grand and impressive, the Townhouse is not just the
                                                brand’s headquarters but also our spiritual home. Today, the Jo Malone
                                                London Townhouse functions as a busy creative workspace while also
                                                retaining the special ambience of the traditional English home that it was
                                                designed to be over 200 years ago.</p>
                                            <p>After the success of the Townhouse Candle collection, inspired by scenes
                                                and spaces within the brand’s home, we are very pleased to announce the
                                                arrival of the the Townhouse Diffuser collection. This collection of 3 diffusers
                                                will gently enrich the atmosphere of any space with the steady scents of
                                                Wild Berry & Bramble, Fresh Fig & Cassis and Lilac Lavender & Lovage.
                                                Think of Wild Berry & Bramble as your ‘welcome home’, the scent for any
                                                hour, the style for any place. Fresh Fig & Cassis recalls a ‘sunlit
                                                morning’ and the late summer nostalgia of fig trees embraced by the sun with a
                                                freshness on the breeze.</p>

                                            <p>The Story Of Rhubarb</p>
                                            <p>As night descends, a treasure from the soil waits to be snapped from its
                                            roots.</p> 
                                            <p>Concealed under bell-shaped jars and with only the soft glow of
                                            candlelight by which to perform this moonlight harvest, fuchsia stems like
                                            tart sticks of rock from nature’s sweet jar are gathered.</p>
                                            <p>This is a practice developed to make rhubarb sweeter. Grown and picked in
                                            the absence of light encourages the release of glucose – and the rewards
                                            speak for themselves. What now feels like a familiar occupant of a classic
                                            English kitchen garden was once one of the world’s most sought-after
                                            treasures. This is a plant with a story in two parts.
                                            First things first. Rhubarb is not a fruit.</p> 
                                            <p>It is in fact, a vegetable. Its
                                            evolution has been a long and curious one, first heralded in traditional
                                            Chinese medicine thousands of years ago, where it appears in ancient medical
                                            books as a trophy of the Earth’s apothecary. Believed to clear toxins and
                                            support digestion, it was used to treat emperors and kings with its
                                            astringent, cleansing properties.
                                            At Jo Malone London, for our Tangy Rhubarb Cologne we’ve decided to match 
                                            this glorious, unruly wonder-stem with citrussy orange and soulful cedarwood 
                                            for a tart, zingy freshness. Eccentric, bright and arch in all its marvellous tartness.</p>
